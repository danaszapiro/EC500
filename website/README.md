Website for API
----------------

I built my website using Flask for Python. The home page allows users to enter a Twitter handle and hit the submit button. The submit button runs the program with danaszapiro's API. When it completes it will redirect to the output.html page. This page will play the video that was created and list the descriptor words given by Google's Image recongnition.
